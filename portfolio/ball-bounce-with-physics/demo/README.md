# ball-bounce-with-physics
HTML5 / JavaScript / Physics Practice

Ball bounce was one of the first projects we did in my high school CS class. I added momentum and collisions to keep things interesting.

To demonstrate and practice my understanding of momentum, which we had been learning in AP Physics, I added proper elastic collisions to my ball bounce program. My programming style and JavaScript as a whole have both changed tremendously since this project.
